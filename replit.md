# TalentCore Staffing Portal

## Overview

This is a comprehensive employment application portal built for TalentCore Staffing, designed to streamline the recruitment process through secure, token-based application forms. The system provides a modern, multi-step application experience with built-in aptitude testing and document management capabilities.

## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server concerns:

**Frontend**: React-based SPA with TypeScript, using Vite for development and building
**Backend**: Express.js API server with RESTful endpoints
**Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
**Routing**: Client-side routing with Wouter
**State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Modular React components with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and dark mode support
- **Form Management**: Multi-step form wizard with progress tracking
- **State Management**: React Query for API state, local state for form data

### Backend Architecture
- **API Layer**: Express.js with structured route handlers
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Token-based secure application links
- **File Storage**: Document upload system with validation
- **Business Logic**: Aptitude scoring, application processing

### Database Schema
The system uses a relational database with the following key entities:
- **Applications**: Complete applicant information and responses
- **Application Tokens**: Secure, time-limited access tokens
- **Application Documents**: File attachments and metadata
- **Recruiters**: User management for recruitment staff

## Data Flow

2. **Application Access**: Candidates access forms via unique tokens
3. **Multi-Step Form**: Progressive data collection across 8 steps
4. **Document Upload**: Secure file handling with validation
5. **Data Persistence**: Real-time form state management
